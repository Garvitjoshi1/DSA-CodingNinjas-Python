# Python program demonstrate
# abstract base class work
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Unlike the other high-level language, Python doesn't provide the abstract class itself.
# We need to import the abc module, which provides the base for defining Abstract Base classes (ABC).
# The ABC works by decorating methods of the base class as abstract.
# It registers concrete classes as the implementation of the abstract base.
# We use the @abstractmethod decorator to define an abstract method or if we don't provide the definition to the method,
# it automatically becomes the abstract method. Let's understand the following example.

class Car(ABC):
    def mileage(self):
        pass


class Tesla(Car):
    def mileage(self):
        print("The mileage is 30kmph")


class Suzuki(Car):
    def mileage(self):
        print("The mileage is 25kmph ")


class Duster(Car):
    def mileage(self):
        print("The mileage is 24kmph ")


class Renault(Car):
    def mileage(self):
        print("The mileage is 27kmph ")

    # Driver code


t = Tesla()
t.mileage()

r = Renault()
r.mileage()

s = Suzuki()
s.mileage()
d = Duster()
d.mileage()
